## 🛠️ DALL-E 3 Generation Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Use ChatGPT Plus or API** - DALL-E 3 produces highest quality results
2. **Copy prompts exactly** - The prompts are optimized for DALL-E's natural language understanding
3. **Request "Vivid" style** - For more dramatic, saturated fantasy art
4. **Generate at 1024x1792** - Native vertical format for cards (closest to 3:4)
5. **Generate at 1792x1024** - Native horizontal format for backgrounds (16:9)

### Consistency Tips
- Generate all monsters in one session if possible for style consistency
- If colors drift, emphasize the hex codes more strongly in the prompt
- Add "consistent with previous images in this series" if generating multiple

### Post-Processing
1. Crop/resize to exactly 3:4 ratio (768x1024 or 900x1200 recommended)
2. Ensure dark edges blend with the card frame
3. Adjust brightness/contrast to match across all cards
4. Save as PNG for best quality

### If Results Vary Too Much
Add to any prompt: "In the exact same art style as a dark fantasy trading card game, with consistent lighting and color grading throughout the set."
